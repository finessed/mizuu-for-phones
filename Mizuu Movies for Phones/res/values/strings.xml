	<string name="newuser_startsearch">This appears to be your first time using Mizuu Movies - or perhaps you\'re upgrading from an earlier version. This means we need to build your video library before anything else!\n\nSearching for files should only take a few minutes to do. If it takes more than a few minutes, please check your internet connection and try again.\n\nMizuu Movies will by default only search for videos that can be played with Android\'s default video player, but if you\'re using a third party player and want additional file support, please check the checkbox below.</string>

	<string name="updateDescription">You\'re about to update the media library database.\n\nThis will only search for new video files and will not update any files already in your library.\n\nIf you want to perform a complete search, including your library files, please check the checkbox below.</string>
	<string name="txtAbout">Mizuu Movies is a portable media centre software for managing your movie collection and playing files from your tablet device.\n\nThe software automatically searches for video files on your tablet device and tries to match and identify these files using The Open Movie Database (TMDb).\n\nMovie details - including title, plot, genre, rating and cover image - are downloaded to a local database on your device, so you can access and manage your movie library without being connected to the Internet.\n\nThanks for choosing Mizuu Movies. We hope you enjoy using the software!</string>
