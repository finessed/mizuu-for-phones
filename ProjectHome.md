### **Background info / notes** ###

This is the open source version of the deprecated Mizuu (for phones).

It is designed for Android phones (version 2.1+ / API level 7). I am no longer working on this project, so hopefully other people will be able to work on it and get something useful going. I'd love to be kept updated on people's work with it.

The code is likely very ugly in many areas. It's based on an old version of Mizuu, which lacked a proper syntax, code optimizations and comments, and it will likely contain minor bugs in some areas. Take it as it is, and hopefully make it better.

_**NOTE:** You'll need to replace the TMDB API key with your own to use the application._

### **Inspiration** ###

If you need inspiration for new features, you're more than welcome to have a look at the current version of Mizuu, available for Honeycomb tablets and Ice Cream Sandwich phones and tablets. You can find it here: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.miz.mizuu

Some of the planned features included:
  * Improved file identification
  * More layouts
  * .nfo support
  * Widget
  * Themes
  * User settings
  * Favourites

### **Need help?** ###

If there are parts of the code you don't understand or you're looking for insight on how I've developed some of the features in the tablet version of Mizuu, feel free to contact me, and I'll try to do my best to get back to you in a timely matter.

### **App description** ###

_(This description was used when the application was online at Android Market)_

Love watching movies? You'll love using Mizuu Movies.

Managing your movies has never been easier. Mizuu Movies keeps track of all your favourite movies on your Android phone (similar to Boxee or XMBC on the PC). Movies are automatically recognized and identified using TMDb with title, plot, cover art and more.

All the movie information is kept in a local database on your phone. This is perfect for travelling because you don't need access to the Internet. You can your entire movie collection with you everywhere.

It's simply entertainment at your fingertips. The easy-to-use and immersive graphical interface will let you browse, select and play your movies. This version of Mizuu Movies has been developed exclusively for phones.

**THIS APP IS NOT MADE TO MANAGE HUNDREDS OF FILES!**

It's made for phones and for managing local files. It does however support a lot more than that, but if something unexpected happens, you're on your own.

**PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FILES ARE CORRECTLY NAMED!**

The app is intelligent and will figure out most names, but it doesn't do magic.
